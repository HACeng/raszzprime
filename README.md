## RA-SZZ ##
**RA-SZZ** (*Refactoring Aware - SZZ*) is an open source implementation of SZZ algorithm initially proposed by Sliwerski, Zimmermann, and Zeller (2005) to find bug introducing changes starting from fix commits. This version analyzes refactorings on revisions to avoid false positives on results.

This project uses other projects as dependencies:
- [RefDiff](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/RefDiff)
- [DiffJ](https://github.com/jpace/diffj)
- [RefactoringMiner](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner)
